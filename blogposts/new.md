Data fetching is a core part of any application. This page goes through how you can fetch, cache, and revalidate data in React and Next.js.

There are four ways you can fetch data:

1 - On the server, with fetch
2 - On the server, with third-party libraries
3 - On the client, via a Route Handler
4 - On the client, with third-party libraries.

In this case we use (if you delelte revalidate.ts will worki it in the code!): 
Alternatively, to revalidate all fetch requests in a route segment, you can use the Segment Config Options.

layout.js | page.js

export const revalidate = 3600 // revalidate at most every hour
If you have multiple fetch requests in a statically rendered route, and each has a different revalidation frequency. The lowest time will be used for all requests. For dynamically rendered routes, each fetch request will be revalidated independently.

And the other way (thats the way thats its active if you dont delelte de revalidate.ts)
If using a Route Handler, you should create a secret token only known by your Next.js app. This secret will be used to prevent unauthorized revalidation attempts. For example, you can access the route (either manually or with a webhook) with the following URL structure:

URL

https://<your-site.com>/api/revalidate?tag=collection&secret=<token>
app/api/revalidate/route.ts

TypeScript

import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'
 
// e.g a webhook to `your-website.com/api/revalidate?tag=collection&secret=<token>`
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const secret = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('secret')
  const tag = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('tag')
 
  if (secret !== process.env.MY_SECRET_TOKEN) {
    return Response.json({ message: 'Invalid secret' }, { status: 401 })
  }
 
  if (!tag) {
    return Response.json({ message: 'Missing tag param' }, { status: 400 })
  }
 
  revalidateTag(tag)
 
  return Response.json({ revalidated: true, now: Date.now() })
}
